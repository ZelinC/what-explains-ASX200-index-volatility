# what explains ASX200 index volatility

this is a group assignment submitted to ECON90011 Quantitative Analaysis of Finance II, at the Unversity of  Melbourne. 

Students are asked to conduct empirical research on the volatility of ASX 200 index, and discover what factors can explain the volatility of it. 

Our group's work received full mark for the assignment, and invited for a presentation in the lecture. I prepared the slides and represented my team to give the speech.
