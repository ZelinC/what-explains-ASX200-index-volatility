# what explains ASX200 index volatility

This is a group assignment submitted to subject ECON90010 Quantitative Analaysis of Finance II, at the Unversity of  Melbourne. 

Students are asked to conduct empirical research on the volatility of ASX 200 index, and discover what factors can explain the volatility of it. 

Our group's work received full mark, and we were invited for a presentation in the lecture. I prepared the slides and represented my team to give the speech.

Now I have become a tutor of this subject.
